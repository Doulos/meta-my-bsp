To make use of this, we need to clone all the depend layers first:

```shell
mkdir yocto-real-time-edge

cd yocto-real-time-edge

repo init -u https://github.com/nxp-real-time-edge-sw/yocto-real-time-edge.git -b real-time-edge-mickledore -m real-time-edge-2.6.0.xml

repo sync
```

Then, in the same *yocto-real-time-edge* directory, create the *extra-layers* sub-directory.
The mete-my-bsp layer must be copied (or cloned) into *extra-layers*:
```shell
mkdir extra-layers

cd extra-layers

git clone https://github.com/Doulos/meta-my-bsp
```

We are ready to build from the *yocto-real-time-edge*:
```shell
cd ../

TEMPLATECONF=extra-layers/meta-my-bsp/conf/templates/build-real-time-edge-with-wireguard soure sources/poky/oe-init-build-env build-test-real-time-edge-with-wireguard

bitbake nxp-image-real-time-edge
```
